#### Stories in the wild

* [Elliot Jaspin's story](http://hnn.us/article/35847) of finding racial cleansing in Census data. 
* [A Death in St. Augustine](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/death-in-st-augustine/) from Frontline / NYT as an example of weaving data into a narrative.
* [Mike Berens](http://sarahcnyt.github.io/stabile/docs/berens_nerds_words.pdf) on the heart of data journalism, written when Bill Clinton was president.
* [60 data-driven ideas in 60 minutes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bwYTBxnSSCBlhEh5_xnoiTejqoNbR5j_NZtVe1iDfTc/edit#slide=id.g2baf1d8ae_030), from Mary Jo Webster and Jodi Upton, NICAR 14.

### Building narratives with Excel

Sometimes you'll use Excel simply as a way to store information that you need to sort, filter and manage in a structured way. This section will help you start thinking about how the 3-dimensional living, breathing world gets represented in two dimensions. 

#### Handouts

* [Cheat sheet](http://sarahcnyt.github.io/classes/docs/macxlcheatsheet.pdf) of keyboard shortcuts for Macs and PCs.
* Tidy data: [Avoiding problems in Excel](http://sarahcnyt.github.io/classes/docs/avoidxlproblems.pdf) and [Best Practices in Excel](http://sarahcnyt.github.io/classes/docs/bestpractices_v2.pdf). 


### Practice data
* [Kevorkian summary](Kevorkian.pdf), for creating a chronology
* [Internal affairs review](internal-affairs-report.pdf) from A Death in St. Augustine, with [a spreadsheet](bubba_harris_protocol.xlsx?raw=true) created from it and several other records.
* List of major league baseball [salaries](MLB2011.xls?raw=true), for practice (courtsey of IRE)
*  Another spreadsheet logging events: the [first 100 days](first100days.xls?raw=true) of the Obama administration. Here's an example of how to turn something like this into a [timeline](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26514347/examples/hundred-days/first100.html). (It only works in Mozilla Firefox)
