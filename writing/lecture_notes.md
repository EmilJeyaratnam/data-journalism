#Lecture notes Nov. 4

* Introductions. Go through my background, Samir's background. Get a good handle on the writing AND data skills of everyone in class. 

* Go through what resources are available to them if they are having trouble with the data part of the data journalism. 
* Readings: What is the most important thing you see in these stories? 
	* Opinion?
	* Domain expertise?
	* They did not depend on the data for their interpretation. The news came from context. Rarely will their stories be a compilation of data. Instead it will be insights derived from an accurate and deep look behind the data. 
	* Discuss other examples that they should bring up. Wait for them to act. 


I expect the Excel exercise to take about 1 1/2 or 2 hours. It's a good test of what they need. What they need to do: 

* Unmerge cells
* Read the footnotes and remove the missing data. 
* Calculate rates.
* Decide how to analyze. Some examples: Are small cities more violent than large ones? Is there evidence that some crimes are under-reported by some big agencies? SHould you average the averages or should you do a weighted average? What's the difference, and what would you say differently? 
* It's interesting to see if they read the homework. 

Go through their ledes.
Standards: Big vs. small - did anyone think to look at how FBI did it? Did anyone go to the site to read up on the data? Why is that a problem? 
What about ranking? 

What kind of news can you get when you can't rank? 

What else do you need?
