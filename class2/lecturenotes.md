##lecture notes week 2	

### Part 1: #s in the newsroom
Slide show and discussion. 

### Part 2: Review of data in excel	

Last week we went through how to use Excel to keep track of events, documents or cases. 

* We went through the types of data that Excel and other programs use: text, long text, numbers, and dates/times.
* We went through how to structure a dataset so that you can do things with it -- the idea of tidy data. 
* We practiced.


This week: 

#### Skills
* Math skills - change, percent change, sums, percents.
* Spreadsheet skills - copying, inserting, unmerging, reformatting.
* Maybe: Tables vs. sheets.

Together, go through the budget example, with them following along. What is the lede of a story when we're done? 

*   Don't forget to check their math
*   Check what they say vs. what they appear to be doing in the money.
*   What's newsworthy?

In groups, go through the North Dakota example. 

Together or in groups go through the population example if there's time. If not, they should do it over the next week, and come back with a lede.
